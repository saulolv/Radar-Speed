config RADAR_SENSOR_DISTANCE_MM
    int "Distance between sensors (mm)"
    default 5000
    help
      Distance between the two magnetic sensors in millimeters.
      This value is used to calculate vehicle speed based on travel time.
      Larger distances provide more accurate measurements but require more space.

config RADAR_SPEED_LIMIT_LIGHT_KMH
    int "Speed limit for light vehicles (km/h)"
    default 60
    range 10 200
    help
      Maximum allowed speed for vehicles with up to 2 axles (cars, motorcycles).
      When exceeded, triggers camera activation and logs infraction with timestamp.
      Adjust according to local traffic regulations for light vehicles.

config RADAR_SPEED_LIMIT_HEAVY_KMH
    int "Speed limit for heavy vehicles (km/h)"
    default 40
    range 10 150
    help
      Maximum allowed speed for vehicles with 3 or more axles (trucks, buses).
      Typically lower than light vehicle limits due to safety regulations.
      When exceeded, activates camera and records complete infraction data.

config RADAR_WARNING_THRESHOLD_PERCENT
    int "Warning threshold percentage"
    default 90
    range 50 99
    help
      Percentage of speed limit that triggers yellow warning status.
      Creates a soft alert zone before actual infraction (e.g., 54 km/h at 90% of 60 km/h).
      Recommended range: 85-95% for effective traffic monitoring.

config RADAR_CAMERA_FAILURE_RATE_PERCENT
    int "Camera simulated failure rate (%)"
    default 10
    range 0 100
    help
      Probability of camera failing to read license plates during simulation.
      Simulates real conditions like poor lighting, motion blur, or dirty plates.
      Set to 0 for perfect reads during testing; 10% typical for real-world systems.

config RADAR_QUEUE_DEPTH
    int "Message queue depth for radar queues"
    default 10
    range 1 128
    help
      Number of messages buffered in sensor and display queues.
      Larger values handle traffic bursts better but consume more RAM.
      Increase to 20-30 for high-traffic areas; monitor logs for overflow warnings.

config RADAR_INFRACTION_LOG_SIZE
    int "Ring buffer size for infractions"
    default 32
    range 1 512
    help
      Number of infraction records kept in memory (circular buffer).
      Each record: ~45 bytes (timestamp, speed, type, plate, validity).
      Consider upload frequency and traffic volume when sizing.

config RADAR_AXLE_TIMEOUT_MS
    int "Axle counting timeout (ms)"
    default 2000
    range 100 10000
    help
      Timeout after last axle pulse before finalizing vehicle measurement.
      Too short: splits long vehicles; too long: merges separate vehicles.
      2000ms covers ~33m at 60 km/h, suitable for most scenarios.

config RADAR_TELEMETRY_INTERVAL_MS
    int "Telemetry logging interval (ms)"
    default 10000
    range 500 600000
    help
      Interval between periodic logging of system statistics and counters.
      Logs vehicle counts, status distribution, and camera performance.
      Use 10000ms for development, 60000ms for production to reduce log volume.
